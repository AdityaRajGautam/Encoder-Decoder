# Encoder-Decoder

<p>This is an GUI based Python application that helps in encodeng and decoding messages.It helps in decoding encrypted messages and encoding messages.</p>
<p>Then encoding and decoding is based on Vigenère cipher method.</p>
<p>Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table.</p>
<p>We have used Tkinter and Vigenere Cipher library to makes this application working.</p>
<p>Easy to understand and use GUI.</p>
