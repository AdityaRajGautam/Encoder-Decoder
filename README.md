# Encoder-Decoder

This is an GUI based Python application that helps in encodeng and decoding messages.It helps in decoding encrypted messages and encoding messages.
Then encoding and decoding is based on Vigenère cipher method.
Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table.
We have used Tkinter and Vigenere Cipher library to makes this application working.
Easy to understand and use GUI.
